## Sentiment Analysis: TextBlob and VADER Implementation

**Background and Overview**

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using two popular sentiment analysis algorithms: TextBlob and VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning). The project focuses on analyzing textual data to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) and includes visualization and evaluation of model performance.

**Data Structure Overview**

**Input Data**:A dataset containing text reviews from a restaurant domain.

**Columns**:

**Review**: The text content provided by users.

**Sentiment**: The corresponding sentiment label (positive/negative).
Executive Summary

**Goal**: Develop a sentiment analysis pipeline to classify text data into positive and negative sentiments.

**Key Steps**:

**Data preprocessing**: Tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stopwords.

**Sentiment scoring**: Applying TextBlob and VADER to compute sentiment polarity.

**Model evaluation**: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate performance.

**Tools and Libraries**:

**Python libraries**: NLTK, TextBlob, VADER, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

**Data Cleaning**:

-Unicode standardization with unidecode.
-Removal of punctuation and special characters.

**Algorithm Comparison**:

**TextBlob**: A simple, rule-based approach for sentiment polarity.

**VADER**: Lexicon-based approach designed for social media sentiment analysis.

**Performance Metrics**:

Heatmap visualization of confusion matrices.

Reports on precision, recall, and F1 score.
